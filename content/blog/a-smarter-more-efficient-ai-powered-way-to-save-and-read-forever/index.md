It’s a reliable, quiet space for thoughtful reading. [Get started with Slax Reader Pro for 1 months free NOW](https://r.slax.com/download)

## Why did we build this？
If you’re a knowledge worker or a heavy information consumer, you probably know the "digital hoarder" anxiety.  We’ve been there as well. We read a lot, save even more, but:

- **The 404 Heartbreak**: Wanna go back to find an insightful article? But it’s a 404.
- **Subscriptions are pricey**: Readwise Reader is great, but the monthly cost adds up.
- **Tools come and go**: We’ve seen Pocket shut down, Omnivore fade away… Urgently needed a self-hosted open source alternative.
- **Information overload**: A mountain of articles pile up. But you have no time to actually read them, and half the time when you do open one, it’s not even worth it.

We’ve been "read-it-later" junkies for almost 20 years.—and none of them we found it really felt right. That’s why we started Slax Reader.

## Innovations We’re Most Proud of So Far ([1 months FREE Pro Trial](https://r.slax.com/download))

Slax Reader is more than a bookmark manager and normal read-it-later tools; It's an **AI-powered personal reading assistant designed** to pull you out of the "saved but never read" article pile to read smarter and understand deeper. [Explore how our AI works](https://r.slax.com/#how-it-works).

**As a welcome gift, early users get 1 months of Slax Reader Pro for free**.
1. **AI Auto-Tagging**: Slax Reader AI analyzes your articles and automatically assigns relevant tags—keeping your library tidy without any manual effort. **Here is the important part: it only picks from your existing tags**. We won’t overstep by inventing new, random categories that clutter your library; we respect the system you’ve worked hard to create. As long-time power users, we know manual tagging is a chore. All it takes is one lazy afternoon to let the pile grow until your entire organization system collapses. Hope auto-tagging can finally liberate you from that burden. ![Slax reader‘s AI-powered automatic tagging and smart categorization](7-auto-tagging.gif)
2. **Instant Summaries**: Get the gist in seconds. Decide instantly: "Is this worth 20 minutes of my life, or is this one-line summary enough?" ![Slax Reader AI summary for quick long-form article insights](8-ai-summary.gif)
3. **Navigational Article Outlines**: Ever feel lost in a 5,000-word essay? Jump straight to sections you care about using an **AI-generated mind-map/outline**. Honestly, this is one of my favorite features. It cuts through the fluff and has significantly leveled up my reading efficiency. ![Interactive AI article outline for navigational reading in slax reader(9-ai-outline.gif) ![Visual interactive AI mind map of article structure](10-ai-mindmap.gif)
4. **Chat with Your Articles**: Stuck on a technical term? Just ask the **AI Chatbot** with any confusing terms, sentences, or the whole piece. Want to brainstorm based on the article? Treat the AI Chatbot like a study buddy right inside the article. ![Using AI chat to explain technical jargon inside web articles](11-ai-chat-definition.gif) ![Slax Reader AI assistant: deconstructing complex ideas](12-ai-chat-ask.gif)
